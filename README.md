# toot

I gave a talk on transforming a simple interpreter into a bytecode
compiler, showing an example in Python.

[outline.text](https://github.com/darius/toot/blob/master/outline.text)
gives the first 10 minutes; after that I went extempore, going through
[the slides](https://github.com/darius/toot/blob/master/slideshow.el).

As a talk it was a failure: lecturing for an hour on technical details
asks a lot of an audience. It might still be of interest as a small
example of compiling to explore on your own.
